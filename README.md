* When I arrive at the site, and I do not have a midi device connected, I should get video instructions.
* When I return with a midi device, I should see a record button, followed by a stream of recent recordings.
* When I click record, and it records my midi input.
* When recording completes, it should be added to the stream.
* For each item in the stream, I should have a play button.
